# BInspected

BInspected is a Python package designed for deep introspection of custom classes. It provides insights into constructor signatures, default values, annotations, and docstrings at runtime. The primary goal of BInspected was to facilitate dynamic testing. It's goal has shifted to a learning project for me to better understand python's meta-programming capabilities.

## Overview

BInspected is a lightweight Python package for deep introspection of your custom classes. Born from a hands-on exploration of Python’s meta-programming internals, it reveals constructor signatures, default values, annotations and docstrings at runtime. It's still in the early stages of development, the more features i've added the more i've learned about exposed about the inner workings of python and how to use these things to my advantage. The primary goal of BInspected was to facilitate dynamic testing, but it's goal has shifted to a learning project for me to better understand python's meta-programming capabilities.

## Installation

This package is not yet and I see no need for it to be published. To install it, simply clone the repository and run the following command in the root directory:

```bash

pip install -e .
 
```

## Usage

Going to hold off on usage instructions until I finish up the CLI today. Since the whole thing is going to change up.

## Roadmap

- [x] Initial implementation of BInspected.
- [ ] Add CLI for easy access to introspection features.
- [ ] Implement additional features for broadening the scope of introspection.
- [ ] Put checks in place to measure performance.
- [ ] Optimize performance and handle edge cases.
- [ ] Write comprehensive documentation and usage examples.
- [ ] Explore potential integration with testing frameworks for dynamic test generation.

## Contributing

Nothing setup or planned for contributions as this is strictly for my own personal learning and advancing my knowledge of pythons meta-programming.
