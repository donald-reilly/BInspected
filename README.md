## Overview

BInspected is a lightweight Python package for deep introspection of your custom classes. Born from a hands-on exploration of Python’s meta-programming internals, it reveals constructor signatures, default values, annotations and docstrings at runtime.

Its core focus is dynamic test scaffolding for repetitive class patterns: by automating the generation of boilerplate test code, BInspected lets you accelerate your test-writing workflow and spend more time validating behavior than hand-crafting stubs.
